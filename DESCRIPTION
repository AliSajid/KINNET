Description: This package provides the functionality to process PamGene's PamChip
    Data Output and generate kinase interaction networks from that.
    This project uses a bayesian algorithm to generate bayesian networks for
     defining dependence relationships between peptide sequences in the PamChip data.
     It then uses a novel kinase assignment method to assign upstream kinases to each 
     peptide which is then output as a graph.
